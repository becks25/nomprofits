    	<b>The concept</b>

    	<p>Nomprofits was borne out of the idea that:
    	</p>

		<p class="center-block">Caring young professionals + Dedicated young non-profit leaders + Food = </p>
		<p class="center-block">
		A space is created where wonderful (and  maybe even audacious) things can happen<br/><br/>
		</p>

		<p>A Nomprofits dinner creates the space to bring those three elements together.  Each Nomprofits dinner will feature three non-profit presentations and a delicious dinner. Each event will focus on a different social issue, and will have programming (and entertainment) to reflect that particular issue. Dinners will accommodate 20-50 attendees to keep the event intimate and so that diners get to know their fellow attendees. Additionally, there is an opportunity to give back built into the evening; a portion of each diner's ticket cost will go to the non-profit of the attendee's choice.</p>

		<p>By the end of the evening, attendees will know each organization's theory of change, impact to-date and programs. We also believe attendees will walk away inspired, connected and satisfied. </p>
