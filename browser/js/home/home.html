			<p><b>The goal of Nomprofits is simple:</b> to connect young professionals to non-profit organizations that are doing the work we care about, so that we can support them in making our world a better one. 
			</p>

			<p>And what could be better than learning about those non-profits over a delicious dinner? Bringing people together over a meal is one of the most effective ways to build relationships. Each Nomprofits dinner will be <b>intimate</b>, <b>informative</b> and <b>fun</b> and our goal is that each participant will walk away with a connection to the non-profits that present (and new friends to boot).
